mini-git-server
===============

Pure-Java WAR capable of hosting git repos and exposing them with git+ssh.
Basically a copy of Gerrit (http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/) - with all the review-related
functionality stripped away and the dependency on a database removed (making it entirely filesystem based).

I use it for integration-testing my git client.
